# Scope of Work

This section describes the environment in which this project can be used. The software is designed as an extension of the management software used by the 118 Emergency Communications Centers. 
This latter allows 118 operators to follow each step related to an emergency request, allowing them to manage the following types of services:

* Emergency / urgent transport;
* Secondary transport;
* Transport by helicopter rescue.

Also, it integrates a cartographic software that exploits the Google Maps for business cartography and allows the staff to visualize always updated maps and exploit all the technologies offered by the GoogleÂ® libraries.
