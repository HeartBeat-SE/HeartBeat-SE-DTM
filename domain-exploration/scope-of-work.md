# Scope of Work

This section describes the environment in which this project can be used. The software is designed as an extension of the management software used by the **118 Emergency Communications Centers**. 
This latter allows 118 operators to follow each step related to an emergency request, allowing them to manage the following types of services:

* Emergency / urgent transport;
* Secondary transport;
* Transport by helicopter rescue.

The Emergency Communications Center makes use of advanced technological solutions that guarantee the security of call reception systems, the user's exact location and real-time control of the position of the available emergency vehicles. 

> The region of Emilia Romagna has 3 Communications Centers , each of which has an advanced telecommunication system for receiving and sorting all requests.

In case of **medical emergency**, it is of primary importance the obtainment of the exact localization of the event together with an immediate evaluation of the urgency level of the call. 

The staff at the time of answering:

1. Locates the event, using a dedicated management software equipped with an **advanced cartographic module**;
2. Evaluates the severity of the event and assigns a **priority** to the request with a color code;
3. Sends an **emergency vehicle** that is suitable for the emergency;
4. Coordinates the development of the rescue intervention, identifying **hospital facilities** that are suitable for the rescued patients;

Once on site, the personnel sent proceeds to assess the injured person and, after the stabilization and first aid maneuvers, contact the communications center to transmit the patient's data, the situation encountered and to obtain information regarding the hospital to which possibly go.
