# Stakeholders and Actors

The HeartBeat project is not designed for a specific market share, but it concerns the well-being of the entire territorial community.

First responders represent the core identity of the software, so users can be considered as the main actors of the software system. 

We can identify two main macro-categories of users, which are not mutually exclusive:

    On one hand, people who obtained a qualifying certificate for the use of a defibrillator - and therefore know the maneuvers to implement in the event of cardiac arrest - belong to the network of first responders.

    On the other hand, business owners who install an AED in the building and register it through the application, have a fundamental role in implementing the network of publicly available defibrillators.

As we said before, being part of one category does not exclude the other one: a user who registers a new AED and is trained to use it, is also a first responder.
