# Conclusions
Working on this project proved to be a great challenge for us, especially
because of our non-technical academic background. 
We found it difficult to remain coherent along all the process of design and trying to integrate all the notions from the course was not easy.

During the planning phase, we found it very useful to conduct an event
storming session, which allowed us to develop a common knowledge and
understanding of the business domain.

Along the way, we encountered some difficulties related to the business
domain specifically but fortunately, we could rely on the opinion of some
domain experts who work in the emergency sector. Indeed, we were able to
take some relevant decisions about the design of the system thanks to their
expertise.

Also, tracking the project using GitHub was quite hard initially as we
approached it at a technical level for the first time. On the other hand, we
had the possibility to explore the potential of GitHub to store, manage and
track projects, both developed individually and in team.
Overall, we agree on the added value that this project gave us, allowing
us to see in practice the importance of the techniques studied during the
course, by applying them in a real world scenario.

## Domain Driven Design
Concerning the Domain Driven Design, we started with a long planning
session in which we tried to pin down all the concepts to have a clear holistic view of the whole system. 
After having identified the domain, we were able to map the context of work, identifying all the entities involved in the system.

The design of bounded contexts was identified as the most challenging
aspect of DDD, whilst the analysis process carried out with the tools and
the philosophy transmitted during the course felt quite natural and effective since the beginning.
Furthermore, developing a ubiquitous language for the project turned
out to be extremely useful to align the team and provide a common under-
standing
