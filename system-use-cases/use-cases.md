# Analysis of Subdomains

In this section we will describe in more specific and precise detail the steps that the system takes in the course of its functioning.

After the event storming phase, three main basic **subdomains** have been identified:

1. Emergency Progress Management (_core_)
2. User Account Management (_generic_)
3. AED Database Management (_supporting_)


To facilitate our understanding, we decomposed the domain into subdomains. In this way, we are able to separate what in fact generates value, and thus, we can analyze more in dept all the aspects of the specific subdomains.

We identified the **Emergency Progress Management** as the core subdomain as it represents the activity that is uniquely performed by the system.

Then, the **User Account Management** constitutes the generic subdomain as it does not generate competitive advantage and it does not distinguish the system in the market.

And finally, the **AED Database Management** supports the system in performing its main functions.
