# Software Architecture

Software architecture is, simply, the organization of the system. This organization includes all components, how they interact with each other, the environment in which they operate, and the principles used to design the software.

We can classify all these elements in three categories:

1. Database System
2. Front-End Technologies
3. Back-End Technologies

In this section we will explore each **micro-service** that composes the system, focusing on the relationships among the components and analyzing how they interact with each other.
