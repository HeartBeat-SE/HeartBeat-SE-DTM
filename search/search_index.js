According to ISTAT , the most frequent causes of death in Italy include ischemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and other heart diseases. Defibrillating within 3-5 minutes of the onset of cardiac arrest can lead to survival by up to 50-70%. But if no one intervenes, their chances of survival drop 10-12% for every minute that passes. In the event of a cardiac arrest , early intervention by people present on site, through the first resuscitation maneuvers and the use of semi-automatic defibrillators, can be decisive for the patient's survival. The project HeartBeat aims at facilitating rapid defibrillation from publicly available Automated External Defibrillators (AED) , through the creation of a system with the following functions: Register of defibrillators present in the territory Integration with the 118 Emergency Communications Center Register of the BLSD trained individuals in the region Integration and Development of the 118 Management and Cartographic System Web portal HeartBeat Mobile App Purpose of the Project The goal of the project is to minimize the time of intervention in the event of a cardio-respiratory arrest. This includes the creation of a unique register of defibrillators that stores data homogeneously in the territory. At the same time, it aims at creating a network of first responders who, after the attainment of a qualifying certificate for the use of a defibrillator, enroll themselves in the register of the BLSD trained individuals and agree to intervene in case of a medical emergency.

The software is designed as an extension of the management software used by the 118 Emergency Communications Centers. This latter allows 118 operators to follow each step related to an emergency request, allowing them to manage the following types of services: Emergency / urgent transport; Secondary transport; Transport by helicopter rescue. Also, it integrates a cartographic software that exploits the Google Maps for business cartography and allows the staff to visualize always updated maps and exploit all the technologies offered by the Google\u00ae libraries.","title":"Scope of Work"},{"location":"domain-exploration/scope-of-work.html#scope-of-work","text":"This section describes the environment in which this project can be used.
