According to ISTAT , the most frequent causes of death in Italy include ischemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and other heart diseases. Defibrillating within 3-5 minutes of the onset of cardiac arrest can lead to survival by up to 50-70%. But if no one intervenes, their chances of survival drop 10-12% for every minute that passes. In the event of a cardiac arrest , early intervention by people present on site, through the first resuscitation maneuvers and the use of semi-automatic defibrillators, can be decisive for the patient's survival. The project HeartBeat aims at facilitating rapid defibrillation from publicly available Automated External Defibrillators (AED) , through the creation of a system with the following functions: Register of defibrillators present in the territory Integration with the 118 Emergency Communications Center Register of the BLSD trained individuals in the region Integration and Development of the 118 Management and Cartographic System Web portal HeartBeat Mobile App Purpose of the Project The goal of the project is to minimize the time of intervention in the event of a cardio-respiratory arrest. Defibrillation is the only therapy to trait someone in cardiac arrest and represents one of the key steps in saving a life from sudden cardiac arrest. The HeartBeat project aims at facilitating rapid intervention from trained individuals while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. This includes the creation of a unique register of defibrillators that stores data homogeneously in the territory. At the same time, it aims at creating a network of first responders who, after the attainment of a qualifying certificate for the use of a defibrillator, enroll themselves in the register of the BLSD trained individuals and agree to intervene in case of a medical emergency.

The software is designed as an extension of the management software used by the 118 Emergency Communications Centers . This latter allows 118 operators to follow each step related to an emergency request, allowing them to manage the following types of services: Emergency / urgent transport; Secondary transport; Transport by helicopter rescue. The Emergency Communications Center makes use of advanced technological solutions that guarantee the security of call reception systems, the user's exact location and real-time control of the position of the available emergency vehicles. The region of Emilia Romagna has 3 Communications Centers , each of which has an advanced telecommunication system for receiving and sorting all requests. In case of medical emergency , it is of primary importance the obtainment of the exact localization of the event together with an immediate evaluation of the urgency level of the call. The staff at the time of answering: Locates the event, using a dedicated management software equipped with an advanced cartographic module ; Evaluates the severity of the event and assigns a priority to the request with a color code; Sends an emergency vehicle that is suitable for the emergency; Coordinates the development of the rescue intervention, identifying hospital facilities that are suitable for the rescued patients; Once on site, the personnel sent proceeds to assess the injured person and, after the stabilization and first aid maneuvers, contact the communications center to transmit the patient's data, the situation encountered and to obtain information regarding the hospital to which possibly go.
